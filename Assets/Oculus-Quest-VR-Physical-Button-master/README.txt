To make the button work, simply attach it as a child of a UI button.

The way that the script works is that it calls the Button Component of the UI Button that it is a child of and makes it work as if you are click on the UI itself.

And set your quest fingers or index finger's tip's capsule collider to OnTrigger and assign a tag on it "index finger"

The button base's tag should be "Button Bottom"

but of course, you can rename the tags with whatever you want.
